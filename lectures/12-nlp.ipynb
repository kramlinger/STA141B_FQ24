    "\n",
    "A _natural language_ is a language people use to communicate, like English, Spanish, or Mandarin. These languages evolved over thousands of years and do not have simple, explicit rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Natural language processing_ (NLP) means using a computer to analyze, manipulate, or synthesize natural language. Some examples of NLP tasks are:\n",
    "* Translating from one language to another\n",
    "* Recognizing speech or handwriting\n",
    "* Tagging sentences with metadata, such as parts of speech (verbs, nouns, etc) or sentiment\n",
    "* Extracting information or computing statistics from text\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to artificial languages like Python and XML, it's much more difficult to extract information from natural languages. NLP is a wide field; we only have time to learn the absolute basics. If you want to learn more, consider reading the entire [Natural Language Processing with Python][nlpp] book or taking a class in computational linguistics.\n",

    "#### The Python NLP Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of Python packages for NLP (try searching online)! A few popular ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Natural Language Tool Kit][nltk] (`nltk`) is the most popular. It's designed for learning and research, so it's well-documented and has lots of features. We will use `nltk` for this class. \n",
    "* [TextBlob][textblob] is a \"simplified\" package. It has a nicer interface than NLTK, but less features.\n",
    "* [SpaCy][spacy] is a \"production-ready\" package, and the fastest of all the packages listed here. Useful for working with large natural language datasets.\n",
    "* [gensim][gensim] is a package for creating topic models, which are a kind of statistical model that predict the topics of a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to learn `nltk`, but you might want to try some of the others if your project involves NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stanford's Core NLP][CoreNLP] library is at the cutting edge of NLP research. It's developed in Java, but several Python packages provide an interface (such as [pynlp][] and [stanford-corenlp][]).\n",

    "\n",
    "We standardize numerical data in order to make fair comparisons, comparisons that are not influenced by the location and scale of the data. Similarly, you can standardize text (tokens) to make sure comparisons are fair and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `\"Cat\"` and `\"cat\"` are the same word even though they're different tokens. Converting all characters to lowercase is one way to standardize a document.\n",

    "Some common standardization techniques for text are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lowercasing\n",
    "* Stemming: Use patterns to remove prefixes and suffixes from words.\n",
    "* Lemmatiziation: Look up each token in a dictionary and replace it with a root word. Similar to stemming, but more accurate.\n",
    "* Stopword Removal: Remove tokens that don't contribute meaning. For example, \"the\" is meaningless on its own.\n",
    "* Identifying Outliers: Identify and possibly remove non-standard \"words\" like numbers, mispellings, code, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "How and whether you should standardize a document or corpus depends on what kind of analysis you want to do. There is no formula; you must think carefully and experiment to determine which standardization techniques work best for your problem."
